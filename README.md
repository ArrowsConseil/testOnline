# Welcome

This template is intended as a project starter for testing:
- [x] your motivation for joining an awesome startup :)
- [x] your competence or your ability to solve problems
- [x] your code quality

### What you should do
You must solve all the problems located in the folder problems. They all come from the website https://www.hackerrank.com/ and you can easily test your solutions on this website. You are welcome to do whatever you want to achieve a beautiful and efficient result but you should use the submissions files in the folder submissions. You should just change the function under the comment "Complete the function below."

### How to do it
Do not hesitate to go to the Hackerrank site where the problems come from. It is necessary that ALL the test cases pass. Be careful to the constraints your code must not be too greedy in resources.

Once you are finished, just send all the completed submissions files by completing the typeform https://antoinelo.typeform.com/to/cQkGbL. We will check that they pass the tests on https://www.hackerrank.com/. If they do you will go on the next step of our interview process.

### Good luck !
