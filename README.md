# Welcome

This template is intended as a project starter for testing:
- [x] your motivation for joining an awesome startup :)
- [x] your competence or your ability to solve problems
- [x] your code quality

### What you should do
You must solve all the problems located in the folder problems.  You are welcome to do whatever you want to achieve a beautiful and efficient result but you should use the submissions files in the folder submissions. You should just change the function under the comment "Complete the function below."

### How to do it
Once you are finished, just send all the completed submissions files (change the extension from .js to .txt) by email to chris@medgo.fr.

### Good luck !
